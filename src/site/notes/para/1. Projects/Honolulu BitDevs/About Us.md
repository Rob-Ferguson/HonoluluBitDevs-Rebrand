BitDevs is a community for those interested in discussing and participating in the research and development of Bitcoin and related protocols. You can be well-versed with or new to the topics - **all are welcome**.

# Socratic Seminars

Our monthly Socratic Seminar events are formatted to foster debate, information sharing and lively discussion. In the weeks preceding the event, discussion topics are collated by meetup members from a variety of sources.

A newsletter is sent out the day of the event which outlines discussion topics. Archives of discussion topics and presentations can be found in the event descriptions of past meetups. The discussion portion of the event is generally never recorded. It is recommended that you have a firm grasp of the basics of Bitcoin in order to extract the most value from our Socratic events.

Check out all of our events [[para/1. Projects/Honolulu BitDevs/Honolulu Bitcoin Homepage\|here]].

# Continued Discussion

Outside of our regularly scheduled events, we have ongoing discussions on Bitcoin-related topics in our [Telegram group](https://t.me/+Y5QaLhylSNJjMDEx). That's the best way to learn, network with others, and catch the latest group updates. You can also follow us on Twitter at [@HonoluluBitcoin](https://twitter.com/HonoluluBitcoin?s=20).
