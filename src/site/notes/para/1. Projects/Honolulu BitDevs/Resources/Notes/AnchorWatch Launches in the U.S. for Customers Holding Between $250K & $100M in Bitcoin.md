> [!QUOTE] [AnchorWatch Launches in the U.S. for Customers Holding Between $250K & $100M in Bitcoin](https://www.nobsbitcoin.com/anchorwatch-launches-in-the-u-s-for-customers-holding-between-250k-100m-in-bitcoin/)
> - AnchorWatch is a [Lloyd’s of London Coverholder](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241118360660/en/AnchorWatch-Becomes-Lloyds-of-London-Coverholder-Set-to-Begin-Operations-in-December-2024) with binding authority of up to $100M per customer.
> - The company aims to transform Bitcoin custody with its [Trident Vault](https://www.nobsbitcoin.com/trident-vault-launched-open-beta-on-testnet/) software, leveraging Bitcoin’s smart contracting language for features like timelocks, multiple spending conditions, and multisig quorums. This ensures strong security and governance facilitated at the Bitcoin protocol level, while embedded regulated insurance reduces risks from theft, kidnappings, and fraud.
> - Trident Vault goes beyond traditional collaborative custody products built on legacy multisig by utilizing [miniscript](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/miniscript/), offering two key advantages:
> 	- **Time-locked recovery paths:** This feature allows Bitcoin to be recovered using different combinations of keys over time.
> 	- **Multisig of multisigs:** This enables AnchorWatch to be a required signer on transactions while you're insured, ensuring that we can never unilaterally control a customer's Bitcoin.
> > "When you combine these two features, it means that you get extra protection while insured, but after your policy ends, the vault seamlessly becomes pure self-custody where you don't need us at all. If you want to renew your policy, then we 'restart' the clocks on the time locks and put you back at full protection," [explained](https://x.com/AnchorWatch/status/1876306331029897536) the company.
> - The service is currently available for retail and commercial U.S. customers who hold between $250K and $100M in bitcoin.

> [!QUOTE] # [AnchorWatch FAQs](https://www.anchorwatch.com/faq?page=1)
> ## Do I have to use Trident to be insured?
> 
> Our insurance is built around the unique security features enabled by Trident and  the distribution of keys and key signers across multiple physical locations. At this time we only insure Bitcoin held in Trident vaults.
> 
> If you would like insurance on another Bitcoin custody platform, please inquire at [hello@anchorwatch.com](mailto:hello@anchorwatch.com). AnchorWatch will consider custom policies with limits of at least $25M.
> 
> ---
> ### Are customer funds segregated?
> 
> Yes. AnchorWatch insurance policies cover a customer's specific bitcoin held in a specific UTXO and is never comingeld with other customers' bitcoin.
> 
> Each customer vault is segregated and protected by a customer’s unique set of private keys. Customers generate their own private keys and AnchorWatch never has access to them. AnchorWatch _never_ has the ability to unilaterally move a customer's bitcoin. This can be verified in the vault's output descriptor on the bitcoin blockchain.
> 
> ---
> ## What does the insurance cover?
> 
> AnchorWatch policies cover a permanent loss of ability to control the bitcoin in an insured Trident Vault. See policy for exact coverage, terms, conditions and exclusions.
> 
> Examples of covered losses include loss of keys due to physical perils such as tornadoes, fires, floods and wildfires; theft of keys including coercion and violent events (‘$5 Wrench Attacks,’ burglary); collusion where both AnchorWatch and customer acted in concert to commit fraud.
> 
> ---
> ## How much do AnchorWatch policies cost?
> 
> AnchorWatch policies are priced in USD, as a percentage of the value being insured. Rates range between .55% and 2% annually of the vault's value based on a prospective customer’s unique risk profile. Many customers will qualify for a rate under or near 1%. The quoted rate includes both the insurance premium and a Trident Services Fee (TSF). A customer can earn rate discounts by opting for higher security options during the insurance application.
> 
> The insurance premium is paid in full at the start of the policy.
> 
> The TSF is waived for the first $250k of bitcoin in the vault and is charged at no more than .25% of the vault’s remaining value, charged monthly based on the average daily value of the vault during the preceding month. The TSF includes all custody technology and AnchorWatch support services. AnchorWatch completes compliance and signs all customer transactions; one transaction is included quarterly at no extra charge.
> 
> In the case of an approved claim benefit, there is a 10% or a 25% deductible. This and other options to earn discounts are selected by the customer during the insurance application. There is a one time Onboarding Fee, which is refundable in the case that insurance coverage is denied for any reason.
> 
> ---
> ## What kind of insurance does AnchorWatch offer?
> 
> AnchorWatch policies are backed by Lloyd's of London syndicates and are written on A+ rated Lloyd's of London paper.
> 
> The AnchorWatch Flagship Trident policy is custody insurance, intended to give Bitcoin owners peace of mind surrounding the storage of their Bitcoin. Policies cover the value of an owner’s Bitcoin stored in Trident Vault and are denominated in dollars with a 12 month duration.
> 
> The policies are specie coverage, similar to fine art or precious articles policies, sold on a Property & Casualty line and include some elements of Crime coverage.
> 
> See Policy for terms, conditions, coverage and exclusions.
> 
> ---
> ## What is Trident and who can use it?
> 
> Trident is AnchorWatch’s proprietary vault software that coordinates secure cold storage of Bitcoin across multiple signing devices held by customers and by AnchorWatch. It’s available for use by AnchorWatch insurance customers and is configured to insured custody standards.
> 
> Trident users can send and receive Bitcoin from Trident, practice coin control (UTXO management). Seamless buy and sell functionality coming soon!
> 
> From the Trident Dashboard, customers can access all information related to their insurance policy, update limits and file insurance claims.
> 
> ---
> ### Does the insurance limit change as the Bitcoin price changes?
> 
> You choose your insurance limit in dollars and pay your premium when signing up for your policy. If you'd like to change your limit during the policy you can easily do so by contacting your agent.
> 
> You get exactly the amount of insurance you pay for. Similar to a fine art insurance policy, you might have a painting appraised at $10M and buy a $10M insurance policy. If the art market is very hot that year, and your painting is now worth $14M, you can either contact your insurance agent to increase the limit to $14M and pay prorated portion of additional premium, or you can opt to remain underinsured.
> 
> ---
> ## Does AnchorWatch have copies of the customer’s private keys? Are there options for recovery if lost?
> 
> AnchorWatch _never_ has the customer’s private keys. The customer creates their own private keys on their own signing device during the Onboarding Call. AnchorWatch provides the customer with three factory sealed signing devices. AnchorWatch _never_ has the ability to unilaterally move a customer’s Bitcoin, in _any_ circumstance. 
> 
> If a customer’s keys are all lost or stolen, the Bitcoin may be able to be salvaged by AnchorWatch and their emergency key recovery partner, using a time locked spending condition enabled by Trident’s use of miniscript. This is advantageous for the customer as the possibility of recovery without filing an insurance claim means that there would be no deductible.
> 
> Customers are provided with their vault’s Recovery Script, which allows them to control their vault using Bitcoin Core, even if AnchorWatch and Trident are permanently unavailable, so long as the customer still has access to their signing devices.
> 
> ---
> ## Why does AnchorWatch hold keys and sign transactions in Trident?
> 
> AnchorWatch holds keys that are required for sending Bitcoin from an insured vault (in addition to the customer signing devices), during the length of your insurance policy. While AnchorWatch _never_ has unilateral control, the requirement that AnchorWatch sign a transaction helps to mitigate the risk of losses of client funds due to loss of signing devices, coercion and internal collusion.
> 
> AnchorWatch keys are more than just a back up plan: Trident is built using Miniscript, which is bitcoin-native tech that allows time locked recovery paths and configuring vaults so multiple entities are both required signers.
> 
> Specifically, a customer holds their own 2-of-3 multisig AND AnchorWatch holds its own multisig keyset. Both keysets must independently complete their signatures before a transaction can be broadcast to the Bitcoin network.
> 
> ---
> ## How do I know Trident is safe?
> 
> Secure custody of Bitcoin is your number one priority and ours too. Here’s why you can trust Trident to secure your Bitcoin in cold storage: 
> 1. Trident code and Trident vaults are audited by three independent external firms who are all leaders in their fields. Most recent audits were completed by Halborn, Doyensec and the lead cryptographers at Blockstream.
> 2. Vaults created in Trident are bitcoin native technology can be accessed via Bitcoin Core in the case of emergency - even if AnchorWatch or Trident are permanently unavailable. When a Trident Vault is created, customers are provided the vault’s Recovery Script and the information required to control their Bitcoin, so long as they still have their signing devices.
> 3. Trident vault configurations themselves can be audited by outside parties if a customer wants additional assurances. The output descriptor of a customer's vault can be verified prior to depositing bitcoin in it to confirm that AnchorWatch can _never_ unilaterally control a customer’s Bitcoin.

# What is miniscript?

> [!QUOTE] [What Is Bitcoin Miniscript? - The Bitcoin Manual](https://thebitcoinmanual.com/articles/btc-miniscript/)
> Miniscript was designed and implemented by Pieter Wuille, Andrew Poelstra, and Sanket Kanjalkar at Blockstream Research as a result of working on [multi-sig](https://thebitcoinmanual.com/security/multi-sig/) implementations but is the conclusion of discussions with several other people who have had to deal with bitcoin scripting in the past and found it difficult or time-consuming to work with and compile.
> 
> **Miniscript is a standardisation of bitcoin scripts; think of it as turning each script into a building block that any bitcoin wallet could use as a method of compiling transactions on the back end based on what the user would like to achieve.**
> 
> Minscript allows the software to automatically analyse a script, including determining what witness data must be generated to spend bitcoins protected by that script. It saves wallet developers time as they don’t need to write new code when they switch from one script template to another and would provide better interoperability for users switching between wallets.
> 
> The structured representation of Bitcoin scripts provided by miniscript allows wallets to be much more dynamic about the scripts they use while also being efficient in compiling transactions and slightly reducing the footprint of a transaction on-chain.
> 
> In support of that dynamism, miniscripts can be created using an easily-written policy language. Policies are composable, allowing any valid sub-expression to be replaced by another valid sub-expression (within certain limits imposed by the Bitcoin system).
> 
> **This brings the promise of more complex [smart contracts](https://thebitcoinmanual.com/articles/what-is-a-bitcoin-smart-contract/) directly on the base chain and offers users more flexible solutions for self-custody that can make it easier and safer to hold your own keys.**
